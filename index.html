<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connectome</h3>

<p>This tool allows to visualize the Connectome that describes how the regions of the brain are interconnected.
    Particularly, the tools enable to perform the exploration of the intrinsic geometry of the brain, by letting the user
    switch quickly different topological spaces where the connectome is embedded.
    With a simple and easy-to-use interface, users can explore all the connections with a edge-on-demand technique and focus on
    very specific area by switching on and off regions of the brain. Simple analytics such as nodal strength and shortest path
    trees can be computed on the fly. This tool has been developed with virtual reality in mind and it is compatible with
    Head Mounted Displays such as Oculus Rift (both DK1 and DK2).</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use it</h3>

<p> This tool has been optimized for Google Chrome Browser.
    Users can upload data and visualize them. All the files needed are in ".csv" format and specifically should be structured are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>locations files (4): each of them contains a different file locations. Each row of the file contains three values that represent the x,y,z coordinates. Each value is separated by a comma.</li>
        <li>network file: this file contains the adjacency matrix of the connectome network. Each value within the same row is separated by a comma. The tool is optimized to deal with weighted graph.</li>
        <li>labelkey file: each row contains the Freesurfer Id label to which the node belongs.</li>
    </ul></p>
